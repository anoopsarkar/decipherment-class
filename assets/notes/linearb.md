## Linear Combinations <span class="text-muted">by Richard Sproat</span>

### Introduction

The script Linear B was used to write Mycenean Greek around the
15th century BCE. Linear B tablets, all of which were accounting
records, have been found both on Crete and at various Mycenaean
sites on the Greek mainland.

Linear B is not well suited for writing Greek; it is an adaptation
of another script (Linear A) that was used to write a language
about which very little is known. Linear A/B did not distinguish
$$/l/$$ and $$/r/$$, nor did it have a way to distinguish similar
triples of sounds like $$/ba/$$ $$/pa/$$ and $$/p^{h}a/$$ (which
were distinct sounds in Greek) and apparently could only be used
to write sequences of vowel (V) or consonant-vowel (CV) syllables
so that a syllable in a Greek word like $$k^hrusos$$ `gold` had
to be broken up as something like *ku-ru-so*. The subscript
$$h$$ indicates aspiration.

### The Problem

Decipher a portion of the Linear B symbol set.

The map below shows the approximate locations of a number of ancient
Cretan towns: the spellings reflect their probable pronunciation
in Mycenean Greek (not their pronunciation in Modern Greek).  We
do not know the location of *Kuprios*; also *Tulisos* and *Kunari*
are two different places. Most of these names have stayed more or
less the same until the present day. However one of the names on
the map (a _distractor_) is not written using the pronunciation
that was used in Mycenaean times.

### The Questions

1. Complete the table below. The list of cities on the map is repeated below:<br>
    Kudonia, Aptarwa, Amnisos, Knossos, Tulisos, Kunari, Phaistos, Luktos, Utanos, Kuprios

    | | Linear B | Pronunciation | 
    |-----------------|

2. Identify the Linear B spelling for the distractor city that is
   pronounced differently as mentioned above. What is the approximate
   Mycenaean pronunciation, given the Linear B spelling? Since one of
   the symbols only occurs in that name, the hint is that symbol
   represents *ja* (pronounced *ya*). If you solve the other nine,
   you can read the distractor name as well.

3. Complete the following table:

    | | Linear B | Pronunciation |

    |1| ![](../img/linearb003.png) | |
    |2| ![](../img/linearb005.png) | |

4. What are the likely pronunciations of the following words:

    | | Linear B | English | Pronunciation | 
    |-----------------|
    |1| ![](../img/linearb070.png)![](../img/linearb054.png) | girl | |
