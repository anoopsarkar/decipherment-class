## Bardi <span class="text-muted">by Catherine Sheard</span>

### Introduction

Bardi is part of the Nyulnyulan language family and is the traditional language of the Bardi people, who
live in and around One Arm Point and the Lombadina/Djarrindjin Aboriginal Communities, along the coast of
Australiaâ€™s Kimberley Region. Although about a thousand people identify as Bardi, only a handful of people
can be considered fluent speakers of the Bardi language. 

### The Problem

In the diagram of the scene (below), note that both you and the speaker are facing the paper. The bird is to
the left of everything else and the kangaroo is to the right of everything else. The cat is behind everything
else and the kangaroo is in front of everything else.
