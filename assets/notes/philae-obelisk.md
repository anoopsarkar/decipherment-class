## The Philae Obelisk <span class="text-muted">by Anoop Sarkar</span>

### Introduction

The most famous artifact in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyph
writing is the [Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).  However
another artifact, called the [Philae obelisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_obelisk) (also called
the Bankes obelisk) was also instrumental in the decipherment.

### The Problem

[William John Bankes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Bankes)
acquired this obelisk after it was found at Philae in Upper Egypt
in 1815.  He noted two inscriptions on it, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
the other in ancient Greek. By comparing the two texts, although
they were not translations of one another, Bankes believed that the
names Ptolemy and Cleopatra must appear in the hieroglyphic
inscriptions.

Both [Thomas Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_%28scientist%29)
and [Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Champollion)
used this information in their attempts to decipher the script. 

### The Questions

1. Pick which of the following cartouches refers to Cleopatra. A cartouche is an oval with a horizontal
line at one end, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name.<br/>

![Mystery glyph](philae2.png 'Mystery glyph')
   * Epaminodas
   * Anaximander
   * Antipater
   * Alexandros
   * Alcibiades
   * None of the above
1. Who is the topic of discussion in this inscription from the Rosetta stone?<br/>
![Rosetta stone inscription](rosetta1.png 'Rosetta stone inscription')
   * Ptolemy
   * Cleopatra
1. Champollion was able to use his knowledge of [Coptic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) to infer
   the sound values for part of the above Rosetta stone inscription:
   `?? ankh djet Ptah mer` (in Coptic, `ankh` means _life_; `djet` means
   _for ever_; and `mer` means _love_). Use the Egyptian
   script to write the words `Ptah` and `mer`. [Ptah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah) is an Egyptian god.
