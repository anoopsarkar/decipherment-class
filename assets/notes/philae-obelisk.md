## The Philae Obelisk <span class="text-muted">by Anoop Sarkar</span>

### Introduction

The most famous artifact in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyph
writing is the [Rosetta Stone]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone").  However
another artifact, called the [Philae obelisk]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_obelisk") (also called
the Bankes obelisk) was also instrumental in the decipherment.

### The Problem

[William John Bankes]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Bankes")
acquired this obelisk after it was found at Philae in Upper Egypt
in 1815.  He noted two inscriptions on it, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
the other in ancient Greek. By comparing the two texts, although
they were not translations of one another, Bankes believed that the
names Ptolemy and Cleopatra must appear in the hieroglyphic
inscriptions each within a cartouche (an oval with a horizontal
line at one end, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name).

Both [Thomas Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_%28scientist%29)
and [Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Champollion)
used this information in their attempts to decipher the script.
