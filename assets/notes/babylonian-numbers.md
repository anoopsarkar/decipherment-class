## Decipher Babylonian numbers

The earliest known writing system originated over 5000 years ago
in what is now Iran, Iraq and other parts of Western Asia. This
writing system, called ``cuneiform,'' was used by the Elamites and
the Babylonians, and also by Persian kings to make their decrees
known, and to audit the tax returns of their many subjects. Cuneiform
was used between 3400 B.C.E and 75 C.E. The characters were inscribed
on clay or stone tablets using wedge-like instruments. Although
many inscriptions have survived, the writing system was not deciphered
by modern scholars until 1846.

In this problem you will carry out the kind of work that these
scholars had to do to decipher the cuneiform writing system. The
following (see image below) is an actual fragment from a Babylonian
educational document that was discovered in 1811. This tablet and
others allowed scholars to unlock the number system used by the
ancient Babylonians. Starting from this point, scholars were able
to extend their understanding to the entire writing system. Many
of the characters are illegible because of the ravages of time.
Nevertheless, it is possible to figure out what the missing characters
should be.  Your job is to fill in the missing characters:
