## Korean shopping list <span class="text-muted">by Anoop Sarkar</span>

### Introduction

The Korean script is called [Han-geul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)
(한글). We will be using an [English romanization of Han-geul]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean") to
represent the Korean pronunciations which uses special symbols like `eu` where a simple mapping to English sounds is not possible[^eu].
Details of the romanization are not important to solve this problem.

[^eu]: For instance the vowel `eu` is a [close back unrounded vowel]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_unrounded_vowel") represented by the symbol ɯ in [IPA]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet") and `ss` is similar to `s` but tensed (with a stiff tongue).

### The Problem

Su-jin (수진) has written down a shopping list for Emily, but Su-jin
decides to test Emily's command of Han-geul by giving her the
pronunciations but not the Han-geul equivalents which Su-jin has
provided to Emily as an unordered list:
소주, 
밥, 
갈비,
소시지, 
후추,
바나나, 
간장,
오이, 
쌈장.
