## Lost in Yerevan <span class="text-muted">by Dragomir Radev</span>

On her visit to Armenia, Millie has gotten lost in Yerevan, the
nation’s capital. She is now at the metro station named **Shengavit**
but her friends are waiting for her at the station named **Barekamutyun**.
Can you help Millie meet up with her friends?

1. Assuming Millie takes a train in the right direction, choose
   the first stop after **Shengavit** from the following options.
   Note that all names of stations listed below appear on the map.
    - **Gortsaranayin** 
    - **Zoravar Andranik** 
    - **Charbakh**
    - **Garegin Njdehi Hraparak**
    - none of the above
1. After boarding at **Shengavit**, how many stops will it take
  Millie to get to **Barekamutyun** (don’t include **Shengavit**
  itself in the number of stops).
1. What is the name (transcribed into English) of the end station
   on the short, five-station line that is currently in construction,
   shown in a different shade on the map?
