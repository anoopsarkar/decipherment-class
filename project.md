Final Project
-------------

The final project is to decipher something. The script may have
been deciphered before but you can do it using a computational
decipherment. Or the script may be undeciphered. The project can
also be on the application of decipherment techniques to NLP tasks
such as machine translation.

### Undeciphered scripts

* Proto Elamite
* Linear A
* Voynich ms.

### Deciphered or well-known scripts

* Linear B
* Mayan hieroglyphics
* Egyptian hieroglyphics or demotic script
* Chinese script into pinyin
* Urdu script into Devanagiri

### Applications of decipherment

* Adversarial text into plain text
* Decipherment for pivoting from low resource to high resource languages in SMT
