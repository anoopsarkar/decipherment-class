There are a lot of natural languages. Some of them have written
scripts. Decipherment implies some familiarity with candidate
languages (although significant steps can be taken even without a
candidate language in mind). You will be required to give a short
presentation (~10 minutes) on a particular language that has a
written script and <i>that you do not speak natively</i>, e.g.,
Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Hindi, Italian, or Maltese.

You should prepare three to six slides for your presentation,
covering language facts (demographics, location, etc.) important
linguistic characteristics (orthography, morphology, syntax),
computational efforts such as resources, tools, papers and most
important the script and how it maps to the spoken language. For
instance,  how many entries are there about the language in the
[World Atlas of Language Structures](http://wals.info/) and what
are the _features_ of the language?

Be creative and have fun.  Asking for help from native speakers or
language experts is great.  But you are ultimately responsible for
the presentation.
